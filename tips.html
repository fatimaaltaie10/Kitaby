        <h4>1. Listen to white noise while reading. </h4>
        <p>Entrepreneur Emerson Spartz told Business Insider that when he began home-schooling himself at age 12 while he worked on his Harry Potter fan site, Mugglenet, his parents gave him one requirement: to read four short biographies a day. A few years later he gave himself a similar goal of reading one non-fiction book a day. How did he do it? He listened to white noise on his headphones. Spartz says it can help anyone read 30% to 200% faster because it eliminates distractions.</p>

          <h4>2. Try an audiobook. </h4>
          <ol>If you're a commuter, audiobooks can be a great way to make use of your travel. Listening to books via iBooks, Audible, etc. is a wonderful antidote to simply not having the time to stop and read.

A Quora thread examined the time it takes to read a book versus listen to a book. Users discovered that although the average word per minute read is lower by an audiobook narrator than oneself (the average adult reads 300 wpm), the benefits are higher. One user said the medium of an audiobook allows him to "read" while multitasking and, thus, finish more books than he would the traditional way.

There are a myriad of scenarios where audiobooks reign: while cleaning the house, cooking dinner, driving, or even exercising.</li>

          <h4>3. Alternate between genres. </h4>
          <p class="first">One of the easiest ways to keep the flow of reading steady is to alternate between fiction and non-fiction books. Reading fiction is often lost on career-focused people, but it can be a fun way to think about different business scenarios. Plus, studies suggest reading fiction increases prosocial behavior.</p>
          <p>One day, you could pick up Harper Lee's latest novel "Go Set a Watchman," and the next buzz through classic business book "How to Win Friends and Influence People."</p>
